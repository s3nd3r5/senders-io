#### How to shop for records

To shop for records generally, if the band is active/modern I try and link or share their official merch/bandcamp (generally you can websearch for the bands website where they usually link their US LP store).  

But otherwise using Discogs is the easiest way to shop for used records. Overall, you simply look through their releases filtering for Vinyl and the album and find a cheaper US release. Try and **avoid good or fair** quality as it usually means "pretty rough but it works". VG is my usual minimum. And do check the sellers shipping options. Sometimes, they make deals for 2+ records (like flatrate shipping) so sometimes ordering from the same store can save some money!.
 
And PLEASE DO NOT EVER spend a lot on a record. Usually $30 is a brand new repress cost for a 2xLP and my maximum. I would much rather have something not on the above list - knowing it wasn't a total rip-off.  

Speaking of represses, represses are always fine. If there are notoriously bad represses/rereleases I'd make it known. But so far only the first two Iron Maiden albums (Self, Killers) suffer from originally bad mastering - so it doesn't _really_ matter if its a repress/release or not. Its mostly purists/nerds who care.

### Else

If you are sick of getting me records for gifts - I do need something to hold some overflow for my records like [found here on etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/record_crate)
