      <h3>remember/recall - what could&#39;ve been a command line tool</h3>
      <p>During a meeting at work when I realized I often forget useful
      commands. So I had the bright idea to create a command line tool that
      would basically append a file with the command you wanted to remember
      that you could search over later if you wanted to recall a certain
      command. I figured I could it could just be a simple bash script that
      recalls your bash-history and appends it to a file, all things that are
      incredibly easy to do... or so I thought.</p>

      <h2>Bread</h2>
      <p><a href='/blog/bread/'>Bread blog!</a> - I started blogging about my bakes in the hopes of learning what I did right/wrong and perfecting my bread. 
      This is a different format than the other blog posts, it's a single page containing, long form, all the different entries.</p>
