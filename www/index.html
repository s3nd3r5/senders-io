      <h3>Venturing back into C</h3>
      <p>For the past two weeks or so I have been diving back into C
      programming. I&#39;ve found it to be a very fun and refreshing experience
      coming off of a slog of Java 11 updates at work. I&#39;ve found comfort
      in its simplicity and frustrations in my &quot;I can do this without an
      IDE&quot; mindset.</p>
      <p>I started C programming in College during a 8 AM course of which all I
      can remember is that it was at 8 AM. I loved programming in C, dealing
      with memory, pointers, no strings, structs, no strings, linking, no
      strings. It was a really interesting difference from the web and Java
      programming I had done previously. Obviously the lack of the
      &quot;string&quot; type made things interesting and initially a challenge
      for me back then. In my most recent endevour I found <code class=
      'inline'>char *</code> to be perfectly suitable for every case I came
      across. It was usually a separate library that was failing me, not a
      fixed char array. This was mostly due to the types of programs I was
      writting in college were text adventures where all of what I did was
      using strings. And my lack of understanding of what was actually
      happening in C was really what was causing all the issues.</p>
