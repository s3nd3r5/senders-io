      <p>I had originally hoped to do more blogging as a way of practicing my
      writing and an incentive to do more hobby programming. The intent was
      never to make this site solely programming, I had actually a few scrapped
      posts about baking and guitar that just didn&#39;t get anywhere... but
      that being said I did have a fair amount of hobbying in 2019 that I can
      share some unfiltered, semi-structured thoughts on.</p>
