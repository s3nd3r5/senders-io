      <h2>First! A New Years Resolution</h2>
      <p>I like to write small hacky things from time to time when I have a
      weekend to myself, or a day, or an hour... But I never had a place to put
      them or the push to complete them beyond their initial hack. So I decided
      I should write a blog about it.</p>
      <p>Also for work I had to write some prose about myself, something beyond
      a technical document or RFC and I realized I am shit at writing my
      thoughts outside of a very direct specific technical way.</p>
      <p>I am not sure if it is the age of the internet I grew up in where most
      of my written communication was informal or for school. But my personal
      writing skills are trash and this is my attempt to kill all the birds
      with one stone</p>
      <h3>What can be expected here</h3>
      <p>My intentions for this site beyond just a landing page with my resume,
      I hope to upload some code-snippets from things I found interesting,
      ideally some recordings, drawings, and model-painting.</p>
      <h3>How often do I intend to update this blog</h3>
      <p>Ideally, whenever I have something that I feel is worth sharing. But
      for the sake of my resolution I want to do at least one post a month, and
      if I am keeping my other resolutions I should have content to put
      here</p>
      <h3>Designing my site</h3>
      <p>Designing this blog actually took way more time than it should have.
      It began when I wanted to tackle a <i>javascriptless</i> website. And I
      found that a bit difficult if I wanted to have code with syntax
      highlighting. So I wrote a python script to generate <code class=
      'inline'>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag wrapping Java code with partial syntax
      highlighting.Possibly mistaking <code class='inline'>highlight.js</code>
      usage documentation. But I would like to prevent having javascript on my
      main website keeping it as simplistic as possible.</p>
      <p>I test the site using both <code class='inline'>tidy</code> and
      <code class='inline'>nginx</code> via <code class='inline'>docker</code>.
      Using tidy I can validate the html (making sure I didn&#39;t miss any
      tags etc) and tidy up any odd spacing. And then visually test it running
      nginx. Having it served up similarly to s3 all the paths will work, and
      is insanely easy to setup! If you&#39;re reading this and have anything
      beyond a simple html file I recommend running docker + nginx over any
      javascript server.</p>
      <p>Then I deploy the site through <code class='inline'>s3-cli</code>
      Which is simple and to the point.</p>
      <h3>In Closing</h3>
      <p>I wanted to include more but I ran out of time today to write more, I
      will probably update this article with more information (and an updated
      timestamp). Or just make another post of my code highlighting task.</p>
