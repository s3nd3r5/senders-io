      <h2>Bread</h2>
      <p>I decided to make a singular dedicated page to my recent bread bakes.
      I am trying to at least keep a log of each bake, what went wrong/right
      in hopes of nailing a recipe that works best for me.</p>
      <h3 id="2020-02-17">February 17, 2020</h3>
      <p> First post! I have done four bakes in 2020 that are worth mentioning.
      Three that ended up rather successful and one lesson learned. Because this is my first post its containing three very similar bakes that were effectively the same recipe</p>
      <h4>Boules</h4>
      <p>I have made two very good boules in 2020.
      I first made a pate fermentee using the following ratio using 50% of my total flour weight: (500g, so 250g).
      <table class="bake-info">
        <caption>Pate Fermentee</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Item</th><th> % </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Flour (Bread)</td><td> 100% </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Water (Room temp)</td><td> 70% </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Yeast (Instant)</td><td> 0.55% </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Salt</td><td> 10% </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      To make the pate, I mixed all the dry ingredients together, then added the room temperature water. 
      I let that loose mixture rest for 15 minutes. 
      Once it was rested, I wet my hands and bench (lightly) and kneaded for roughly 8 minutes. 
      After kneading I tightened the dough into a boule and let it sit in a plastic wrap covered greased bowl for an hour.
      After an hour I placed it into the friged, as is. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The next day, basically in the AM when I had time to bake I took the dough out of the fridge, cut it into smaller bits (four), and let it come to room temperature (ish, about an hour). I prepped the same ratio above except with warmer water (~108&deg;F). When I added the water to the dry ingredients I added the pate along with it. I used the curved edge of my scrapper to cut into the pate and incorporate it fully. Once I felt it was all one loose mess I let it sit for 15 minutes. 
      After the 15 minutes I wet my hands, and bench, and began to knead the dough for 8 minutes. After kneading I formed the dough into a boule and placed it into a greased bowl covered in plastic wrap. I let that sit on my bench for 90 minutes or so. After the first proof I dampened my bench and took the risen dough out of the bowl and lightly pressed it into a thick circle. I then took the, what would be, corners of the mass and folded them into the center, rotating after each fold. This process creates a boule shape while creating tension. I would continue to do this about 8-10 times really until it felt like I couldn't grab anymore/it wouldn't stick. Then I flipped the dough over and tightened the boule in a scooping motion as I rotated it. Then placed it into my floured banneton. I let it rise again for about 45 minutes. Around the 30 minute mark I would preheat my oven to 500&deg;F. 
      Once the oven was preheated and its been at least 45 minutes. I flipped out the dough onto the peel (dusted with corn flour) and scored it. I then misted the top with a spray bottle of water and slid it onto my baking stone. While preheating the oven I also set a kettle to boil some water which I poured into the preheating baking sheet on the bottom rack. I set the timer for 10 minutes and every two minutes or so I would add more boiling water. After 6 minutes I rotated the dough using the peel (careful not to damage it). And misted the facing side with the spray bottle (I found the back is lighter so this helps make the entire steaming more even). After the turn and mist I add twenty minutes to my timer and drop the temperature to 450&deg;F. 
      </p>
      <p> This produces a nice, well risen boule with a golden brown crust. </p>
      <p> I skipped the pate in my most recent bake and just did 100% (500g) starting from "day 2". I also subtituted 100g with AP flour.</p>
      <h4> Baguettes </h4>
      <p> I actually did the boule recipe first for my baguettes. I did aiming for 1000g flour so my pate was with 500g and a 50/50 AP/Bread mix. I screwed up the ratio for yeast and added almost double. The recipe is essentially the same with the final steps being the difference. </p>
      <p>After the first proof I sliced the dough into three chunks. Then I formed those into boules and let them sit for 5 minutes. After resting I then rolled them into batards and let them sit for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes I then rolled them into baguettes and placed them on the baguette sheet. And then baked them. After letting them rise for 45 or so minutes. </p>
      <h4>Accidents</h4>
      <p> Baguette rolling is hard. And I need to let the dough rest longer between each shape.</p>
      <p> 1000g for three ~15 inch baguettes is too much. I would do 750g next time. </p>
      <p> Proofing on the sheet is not recommended in the future as the rose really well (probably all that extra yeast!) and ended up sticking together. </p>
      <p> I broke my oven light with my spray bottle. And I ruined my cast irons seasoning usnig that for the boiling water. </p>
      <h4>What to do next time</h4>
      <p>Next french style boule, I want to do a pate again. As I've only done it for one boule loaf. And I want to try making two loafs from it. </p>

      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bakewithjack.co.uk">Bake With Jack's Youtube Channel</a> really helped me shape up my shaping up.
