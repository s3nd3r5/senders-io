      <h2>Venturing back into C</h2>
      <p>For the past two weeks or so I have been diving back into C
      programming. I&#39;ve found it to be a very fun and refreshing experience
      coming off of a slog of Java 11 updates at work. I&#39;ve found comfort
      in its simplicity and frustrations in my &quot;I can do this without an
      IDE&quot; mindset.</p>
      <p>I started C programming in College during a 8 AM course of which all I
      can remember is that it was at 8 AM. I loved programming in C, dealing
      with memory, pointers, no strings, structs, no strings, linking, no
      strings. It was a really interesting difference from the web and Java
      programming I had done previously. Obviously the lack of the
      &quot;string&quot; type made things interesting and initially a challenge
      for me back then. In my most recent endevour I found <code class=
      'inline'>char *</code> to be perfectly suitable for every case I came
      across. It was usually a separate library that was failing me, not a
      fixed char array. This was mostly due to the types of programs I was
      writting in college were text adventures where all of what I did was
      using strings. And my lack of understanding of what was actually
      happening in C was really what was causing all the issues.</p>
      <h3>The Project</h3>
      <p>I started working on an application I had been meaning to develop
      called <a href=
      'https://github.com/s3nd3r5/reminder'><b>reminder.d</b></a>. This daemon
      would monitor for reminder notifications I would send via a CLI. It queue
      them up based on some time set to send the notification. I ended up
      writing both the CLI and the daemon in this past week, both in C.</p>
      <h4>The CLI</h4>
      <p>The CLI <b>remindme</b> took in messages and appened them to a file.
      This file would be monitored by the daemon later on. Each reminder
      consisted of three parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Message</i> - The body of the notification.</li>
        <li><i>Time</i> - This is either a datetime or a period for when the
        notification should send.</li>
        <li><i>Flag</i> - The Flag was set by the CLI when written to the file,
        this marks the status of the reminder</li>
      </ul>After a notification is written the daemon will pick up the
      notification and notify if the time set is now/past.
      <h4>The Daemon</h4>
      <p>The Daemon <b>reminder-daemon</b> opened and tailed a file at
      <i>/usr/local/etc/reminder.d/$USER.list</i>. It would tail the file
      monitoring any incoming lines parsing them into reminders. The syntax of
      the reminder is <code class='inline'>FLAG EPOCHSEC MESSAGE</code> .
      Tokenizing on spaces it was then added to a linked-list sorted by time.
      Every second it checks the file for any new lines, adding reminders as
      they come in, then check the head of the list. If the reminder at the
      head is ready to be notified the daemon pops it off the list and sends
      the notification. After a notification is sent successfully the daemon
      modifies that line in file updating its <code class='inline'>FLAG</code>
      to &#39;d&#39;. This is so when the daemon starts back up it skips the
      reminder. Notifications are sent via <i>libnotify</i>: <code class=
      'inline'>Reminder - $DATETIME</code> with the message body. They are also
      set to last until dismissed manually, this way if were to walk away, once
      I sat down I&#39;d see the stale reminder waiting.</p>
      <h4>Future Plans for Reminder.d</h4>
      <p>Having a system to create and send myself notifications is incredibly
      useful but having them limit to just the computer I sent them on makes
      them a very limited. I have been using them at work for the last few days
      and its nice to be able to tell myself to remeber to email a person after
      lunch. But I would like to be able to tell myself things later in the
      day. I have planned since the beginning to have a remote server I can
      sync the reminders through. In addition having an application running on
      my phone that also gets and sets reminders.</p>
      <p>Remote syncing would change entirely how I deal with reminders in the
      file.</p>
      <pre>
<code>
 struct remnode { 
   long fileptr; 
   struct reminder* reminder; 
   struct remnode* next; 
 }; 
      </code></pre>
      <p>Is currently the struct I use to keep track of the reminders.
      <code class='inline'>fileptr</code> is the line of the file where the
      reminder is, so I can <code class='inline'>fseek</code> back to the
      location and overwrite its flag. I cannot currently think of a way to
      keep the files perfectly identical without introducing countless
      edgecases. What I do think might work is providing some form of UUID.
      When a remote pull tells the systems daemon that a notification has been
      cleared it can mark it by ID. Right now the fileptr is effectively its
      ID, but that will not work anymore. A composite key of the daemons own id
      (generated at install?) with a new ID of each incoming message would help
      ensure uniqueness across ID generations across multiple systems.</p>
      <h3>What I&#39;ve learned</h3>
      <p>First off, I probably could&#39;ve done this in bash. With
      <code class='inline'>date notify-send git awk cron</code> and a few other
      useful commands I could very easily keep track of file changes and push
      notifications at a certain time. But seeing as I scrap together bash
      scripts all the time I though C would make things more fun.</p>
      <p>Writing manpages was the probably the most fun I had working on the
      project. They have a simple elegance to them, similar to C. That being
      said you could FEEL the age of the language. Every single decision is
      there to make things simple to parse. Even compared to modern markup the
      explicit direct nature of the language made it so easy to learn. Every
      tag served a specific purpose and each objective I had had a flag to do
      it.</p>

      <p>Libnotify was insanely easy to work with, from a programming
      perspective.</p>
      <pre><code>
  NotifyNotification *notif = notify_notification_new(title, rem-&gt;message, &quot;info&quot;);
  notify_notification_set_app_name(notif, APP_NAME);
  notify_notification_set_timeout(notif, NOTIFY_EXPIRES_NEVER);

  GError* error = NULL;
  gboolean shown = notify_notification_show(notif, &amp;error);
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>In closing</h3>
      <p>Overall, this was an extremely fun first week of engineering. I look
      forward to what I am able to do syncing and sending notifications on
      android.</p>
