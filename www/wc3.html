  <h4>Warning! Do Not Update</h4>Once you launch the game it will prompt you to
  update: <strong>DO NOT UPDATE THE GAME</strong> . After clicking No it may
  ask you again on launch again (sometimes). Just keep clicking NO.
  <h3 id='setupdone'>Done!</h3>Now you&#39;ve setup Warcraft 3. Next you need
  to setup a virtual LAN
  <h2 id='lansetup'>Setting up a Virtual Lan</h2>In this section I&#39;ll show
  a guide for setting up <a href='https://www.zerotier.com/'>ZeroTier</a>.
  <h3 id='adminnotice'>Before you continue</h3>Only one person
  <strong>needs</strong> to setup a network. Everyon else can join an existing
  network through the network&#39;s creator (<strong>admin</strong>). And once
  you&#39;ve been authorized by the admin you can join/unjoin as you please.
  The admin doesn&#39;t even need to be in the same game / online.
  <h3>Admin | Network Setup</h3>If you want to be the network admin you can
  create a network by first creating an account with ZeroTier. You&#39;ll need
  to supply a verifiable email but that is it. Here is a quick summary of how
  to setup. A full guide can be found at <a href=
  'https://zerotier.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/8454145/Getting+Started+with+ZeroTier'>
  Zero Tiers own setup guide</a>

    <span class='scaled-half'><img src='/imgs/wc3/create-network.png' alt=
    'Create a Network'></span><br>
    <i class='small'>Hover to Zoom</i>
  </div>
  <h4>Your Network ID</h4>Your network ID will be present on the network page.
  The example netowrk here is: <code class='inline'>17d709436c634b2b</code>.
  You will share this with the members.
  <h4>Admin | Network Settings</h4>You shouldn&#39;t have to do anything
  custom, just authorize the users who join your network. This can be done by
  either adding them directly, or checking the authorize box. You can add them
  from the settings menu at the bottom:
  <div>
    <span class='scaled-half'><img src='/imgs/wc3/add-remove.png' alt=
    'Add remove users section'></span><br>
    <i class='small'>Hover to Zoom</i>
  </div>
  <h3>Member | Download</h3><i>Note Admins must also join their own
  network!</i> Member&#39;s first must download the application: <a href=
  'https://www.zerotier.com/download/'>Zero Tier 1</a>.
  <h3>Member | ZeroTier UI</h3>The ZeroTier UI is just a system-tray icon. Just
  right click to perfom any of the actions listed below. (It&#39;s the icon
  that shares the icon from the website!)
  <div>
    <span class='scaled-half'><img src='/imgs/wc3/tray.png' alt=
    'ZeroTier Tray Icon'></span><br>
    <i class='small'>Hover to Zoom</i>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class='scaled-half'><img src='/imgs/wc3/menu.png' alt=
    'ZeroTier Tray Menu'></span><br>
    <i class='small'>Hover to Zoom</i>
  </div>You can right click the tray-icon to open the menu. Here you will see
  your Node Id. Example: <code class='inline'>Node ID: 2d213b67f2</code>
  <h4>Member | Add network</h4>To join simply paste the network ID in the form.
  You can get the ID from the Network Admin.
  <div>
    <span class='scaled-half'><img src='/imgs/wc3/join.png' alt=
    'Join prompt'></span><br>
    <i class='small'>Hover to Zoom</i>
  </div>
  <h4>Admin | Authorize the Member</h4>The Admin will then need your
  <strong>Node ID</strong> and will authorize you in their network settings.
  <div>
    <span class='scaled-half'><img src='/imgs/wc3/members-view.png' alt=
    'Members View'></span><br>
    <i class='small'>Hover to Zoom</i>
  </div>
  <h3>Member | Reboot</h3>Now that you&#39;ve connected and setup I recommend
  rebooting here. You can also reboot upon installation too to be safe.
  <h3>Member | Verify connectivity</h3>You can open the menu and click
  &quot;Show Network&quot; which will show you your connected networks. You
  should see <code class='inline'>Status: OK</code>. You can click the connect
  checkbox here to connect/disconnect. Or click the network from the menu
  directly.
  <div>
    <span class='scaled-half'><img src='/imgs/wc3/connection.png' alt=
    'Connection View'><br>
    <i class='small'>Hover to Zoom</i></span>
  </div>
  <h3><span class='scaled-half'>Admin | Verify everyone is
  connected</span></h3><span class='scaled-half'>You can verify the connected
  nodes by looking at the network view under Members. You should see Last Seen
  &quot;ONLINE&quot; and their Physical IP - this will mean they&#39;re
  connected successfully. You can add names and descriptions to help manage who
  is who in case someone loses connectivity.</span>
  <h2><span class='scaled-half'>Creating a LAN Game</span></h2><span class=
  'scaled-half'>At this point you should be able to create a LAN game. It will
  ask you to install Bonjour services. Click yes. The game may hang for a bit
  while this happens, that is normal. Authorize the network firewall popup if
  it does.</span>
  <h2><span class='scaled-half'>Troubleshooting</span></h2><span class=
  'scaled-half'>The network Admin can troubleshoot any connectivity issues by
  checking if the Member&#39;s are present in their network settings.</span>
  <h3><span class='scaled-half'>Status:
  Request_Configuration</span></h3><span class='scaled-half'>If you are stuck
  in this status you can delete the network. Reboot. Then re-add the network
  and have the admin re-authorize you if necessary. This may take a few minutes
  before you&#39;re IP appears in the network settings for the admin.</span>
