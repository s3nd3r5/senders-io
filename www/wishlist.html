  <h1>Wishlist</h1>
  <p>If you have any questions you can always reach out to me or the person
  denoted under each section. I have broken things into categories with no real
  priority between the areas/items. Gunpla is welcome, and I can update this
  with the models I own later, but they&#39;re hard to get since most sites
  sell out of the ones I want and I have a backlog at the moment.</p>
  <h2>Records</h2><strong><a target="_blank" href=
  "https://www.discogs.com/wantlist?user=senders">Records I want</a> - Rather
  than tabularize the records I have my eye on. I have just tagged them on
  discogs.</strong>
  <p><a target="_blank" href=
  "https://www.discogs.com/user/senders/collection">What I already own</a> -
  You can double check with Carolynn</p>
  <h3>General suggestions</h3>
  <p>Since that list is clearly not exhaustive (I don&#39;t have the time to
  flag everything). I will essentially just list some bands I like and own very
  few records of (sorted alphabetically)</p>

  <h3>Owned but not listed</h3>
  <p>I have some preorders on the way, so I don&#39;t have the catalog info to
  put into Discogs</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blackwater Holylight - Silence/Motion</li>
    <li>Emma Ruth Rundle - Some Heavy Ocean, Engine of Hell</li>
    <li>Khemmis - Deceiver</li>
    <li>Quicksand - Distant Populations</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Shopping for records</h3>
  <p>If you have used <a href="https://www.discogs.com" target=
  "_blank">Discogs</a> before I find it a bit tough to navigate. Just be aware
  of what country the seller is from as that typically relates to ship
  time.</p>
  <p>I would be happy with any record if you think I would like it. Be wary of
  quality of the media. Typically anything less than VG+ on discogs is
  questionable. I don&#39;t care much about getting an original vs reissue.</p>
  <p>If a release is 2020 or 2021 - you can do a bit of research and sometimes
  find the actual merch store - but watch out for turnaround time with any
  actual record label sites/store fronts. Typically, if a record is released
  within the last year or so its price is $20-$30 before shipping - so if
  it&#39;s new (even reissue) try finding a real storefront before going second
  hand.</p>
