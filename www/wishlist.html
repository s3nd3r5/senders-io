  <h1>Wishlist</h1>
  <p>If you have any questions you can always reach out to me or the person
  denoted under each section. I have broken things into categories with no real
  priority between the areas/items. Gunpla is welcome, and I can update this
  with the models I own later, but they&#39;re hard to get since most sites
  sell out of the ones I want and I have a backlog at the moment.</p>
  <h2>Records</h2><strong><a target="_blank" href=
  "https://www.discogs.com/wantlist?user=senders">Records I want</a> - Rather
  than tabularize the records I have my eye on. I have just tagged them on
  discogs.</strong>
  <p><a target="_blank" href=
  "https://www.discogs.com/user/senders/collection">What I already own</a> -
  You can double check with Carolynn</p>
  <p>If you have used <a href="https://www.discogs.com" target=
  "_blank">Discogs</a> before I find it a bit tough to navigate. Just be aware
  of what country the seller is from as that typically relates to ship
  time.</p>
  <p>I would be happy with any record if you think I would like it. Be wary of
  quality of the media. Typically anything less than VG+ on discogs and reverb
  is questionable. I don&#39;t care much about getting an original vs
  reissue.</p>
  <p>If a release is 2019 or 2020 - you can do a bit of research and sometimes
  find the actual merch store - but watch out for turnaround time with any
  actual record label sites/store fronts.</p>
