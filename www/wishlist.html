    <h1> Wishlist </h1>
    <p>
		If you have any questions you can always reach out to me or the person denoted under each section.
    I have broken things into categories with no real priority between the areas/items. Gunpla is welcome, and I can update this with the models I own later, but they're hard to get since most sites sell out of the ones I want and I have a backlog at the moment. 
		</p>
    <h2> Records </h2>
    <strong>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/wantlist?user=senders">Records I want</a> - Rather than tabularize the records I have my eye on. I have just tagged them on discogs. </strong>
    <p><a target="_blank"href="https://www.discogs.com/user/senders/collection">What I already own</a> - You can double check with Carolynn</p>
    <p> I would recommend using either <a target="_blank" href="https://lp.reverb.com">Reverb LP (lp.reverb.com)</a> or the publishers own website. If you have used <a href="https://www.discogs.com" target="_blank">Discogs</a> before I find it harder to navigate. Just be aware of what country the seller is from as that typically relates to ship time. </p>
    <p> I would be happy with any record if you think I would like it. Be wary of quality of the media. Typically anything less than VG+ on discogs and reverb is questionable. I don't care much about getting an original vs reissue. </p>
    <p> You can usually find quality reissues on Reverb, but cheaper albums on discogs.</p>

    <p> For the Dwarf/Skaven I want a cool model to build but feel free to get anything :) O.G Warhammer is a +1. </p>
    <h2> Stationary </h2>
    <p> For this I just like fountain pen inks or fountain/dip pens. If you think its a neat shade or cool looking pen feel free to grab it. I have linked a few items I have had my eye on. But if you browse <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetpens.com">Jetpens</a> and look under their fountain pen inks. Any ink will do!</p>
